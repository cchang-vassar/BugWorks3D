# Vision Document
## High Level Description
A 3D simulator for Braitenberg vehicles in custom arenas. Users are able to design the internal configuration of their vehicles using a drag-and-drop interface, with pre-built vehicle componenets available for users to plug and play. The user can also design their own environments to simulate the vehicles in, with basic features including the number of light sources in the environment, obstacles and their positions, etc. The cumulative movement trajectories of the vehicles can be tracked as the simulations are run, and a visual recording of the simulation can also be downloaded afterward.

## Main Features
1.  A drag-and-drop UI for building Braitenberg vehicles
2.  A drag-and-drop UI for building custom environments
3.  A simulation UI for running the vehicles in environments
    * A 2D bird's eye view of environment
    * A 3D angled bird's eye view of environment
    * [stretch] multiple custom camera angles to follow the vehicle(s) with (e.g. first-person)
4.  Toggle on/off 2D and 3D view
5.  Recordings of simulation
    * 2D bird's eye view
    * 3D angled bird's eye view
    * [stretch] from multiple custom camera angles
